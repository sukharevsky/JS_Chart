Pure JS chart implementation

Pure JS Library that implements the chart Scroll behavior using HTML5 Canvas / JavaScript, according to initial requirements below.
 
This will involve but not limited to:
1) Create a sample dataset which contains data from t=0 to t=100.
2) Create an axes which is initially drawn from t=0 to t=10.
3) Create a Run button on a page.
4) When clicked, it should plot the data from t=0 to t=10 and then start scrolling (from left to right) till it reaches t=100. The labels along the x-axis should also get updated.
